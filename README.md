# Steps involved in the Design
1. Build RTL - in this case, a simple Cortex M3 processor core with two memory components connected through AHB Bus Matrix.
2. Use ARM's Keil uVision5 to write some basic C/Assembly and generate a hex file to be written onto the memory.
3. RTL simulation - using Vivado (to be done)

The files required for Cortex M3 can be downloaded from ARM's official page (requires an ARM account, which one can sign up for free, to download the files):
